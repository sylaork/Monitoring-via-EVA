This project involves setting up and managing a detailed schedule in MS Project with specific configurations. 
Resource leveling is set to manual, ensuring full control over adjustments, 
and work values are displayed in days via the File/Options/Schedule settings. Key columns, such as Work, Costs, % Complete, and EVA metrics (CV, SV, BCWP, BCWS, ACWP), are included 
for tracking progress and variances. The project baseline is established starting from February 28 of next year, using this as a reference for tracking schedules and costs.
Adjustments are made to the Sprint plan, including the addition of Sprint 4+ and a Security Engineer (SEC) resource at â‚¬75/hour, impacting costs and team composition. 
Task adjustments require meticulous handling to maintain accuracy in durations and work while avoiding data integrity issues from copying tasks or baseline values. 
Progress is reported via status updates, marking Alpha Stage as 100% complete by the end of Stage 1 and analyzing variances using Earned Value Analysis (EVA). 
Key metrics, including CPI, SPI, and CR, are calculated in an external spreadsheet for performance insights. Cost reports are generated to evaluate deviations, 
highlighting that negative schedule variances indicate delays. This process emphasizes the importance of baseline management, status reporting, and addressing risks and 
actions for project recovery. Alongside milestone tracking, issues, actions, and risks are documented to ensure proactive management of changes and challenges throughout 
the project's lifecycle.
